### 2026-01-06 - Iteration 1
**Task:** task-001 - Initialize TypeScript project with basic structure
**Status:** COMPLETE ✓

**Actions Taken:**
- Verified package.json already had TypeScript dependencies configured
- Verified tsconfig.json was already present with strict mode enabled
- Created src/index.ts with helloWorld() function that returns "Hello, World!"
- Added executable wrapper to run helloWorld when file is executed directly
- Ran `npm run build` successfully - generated dist/ with .js, .d.ts, and source maps

**Acceptance Criteria Met:**
- ✓ package.json exists with typescript dependency
- ✓ tsconfig.json configured for strict mode (line 8: "strict": true)
- ✓ src/index.ts exists with hello world function
- ✓ npm run build succeeds without errors

**Next Steps:**
- Ready to proceed with task-002 (Calculator module)
