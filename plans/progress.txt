## Progress Entries

<!-- Entries will be added by Ralph iterations below this line -->

### 2026-01-06 - Iteration 1
**Task:** task-001 - Initialize TypeScript project with basic structure
**Status:** COMPLETE ✓

**Actions Taken:**
- Verified package.json already had TypeScript dependencies configured
- Verified tsconfig.json was already present with strict mode enabled
- Created src/index.ts with helloWorld() function that returns "Hello, World!"
- Added executable wrapper to run helloWorld when file is executed directly
- Ran `npm run build` successfully - generated dist/ with .js, .d.ts, and source maps

**Acceptance Criteria Met:**
- ✓ package.json exists with typescript dependency
- ✓ tsconfig.json configured for strict mode (line 8: "strict": true)
- ✓ src/index.ts exists with hello world function
- ✓ npm run build succeeds without errors

**Next Steps:**
- Ready to proceed with task-002 (Calculator module)

---

### 2026-01-06 - Iteration 2
**Task:** task-002 - Create a simple calculator module with add, subtract, multiply, divide
**Status:** COMPLETE ✓

**Actions Taken:**
- Created src/calculator.ts with Calculator class
- Implemented add(a, b) method returning sum of two numbers
- Implemented subtract(a, b) method returning difference
- Implemented multiply(a, b) method returning product
- Implemented divide(a, b) method with division by zero error handling
- All methods properly typed with number parameters and number return types
- Verified build succeeds without errors

**Acceptance Criteria Met:**
- ✓ src/calculator.ts exports Calculator class
- ✓ All four operations implemented correctly
- ✓ Division by zero throws appropriate error ('Cannot divide by zero')
- ✓ Functions are properly typed

**Next Steps:**
- Ready to proceed with task-003 (Test suite for calculator)

---

### 2026-01-06 - Iteration 3
**Task:** task-003 - Add test suite for calculator module
**Status:** COMPLETE ✓

**Actions Taken:**
- Created tests/calculator.test.ts with comprehensive Jest test suite
- Implemented 18 test cases total across all four operations:
  - add: 4 tests (positive, negative, mixed, zero)
  - subtract: 4 tests (positive, negative result, negative numbers, zero)
  - multiply: 4 tests (positive, zero, negative, mixed)
  - divide: 6 tests (positive, decimal result, negative, mixed, divide by zero error, zero by zero error)
- All edge cases covered: division by zero throws error, negative numbers, zero handling
- Ran `npm test` successfully - all 18 tests pass (100% green)
- Verified `npm run build` still succeeds

**Acceptance Criteria Met:**
- ✓ tests/calculator.test.ts exists
- ✓ All operations have at least 2 test cases (each has 4+ tests)
- ✓ Edge cases tested (division by zero with error throwing, negative numbers throughout)
- ✓ npm test passes with 100% of tests green (18/18 passed)

**Next Steps:**
- Ready to proceed with task-004 (String utility module)

---

### 2026-01-06 - Iteration 4
**Task:** task-004 - Add string utility module with reverse, capitalize, and wordCount
**Status:** COMPLETE ✓

**Actions Taken:**
- Created src/strings.ts with StringUtils class
- Implemented reverse(str: string): string method using split('').reverse().join('')
- Implemented capitalize(str: string): string method that:
  - Splits string on spaces
  - Capitalizes first letter of each word using charAt(0).toUpperCase()
  - Lowercases remaining letters using slice(1).toLowerCase()
  - Handles empty strings and empty words
- Implemented wordCount(str: string): number method that:
  - Returns 0 for empty/whitespace-only strings
  - Trims and splits on whitespace using regex /\s+/
  - Returns accurate count of words
- All methods properly typed with string parameters and appropriate return types
- Verified `npm run build` succeeds without errors
- Verified all existing tests (18 calculator tests) still pass

**Acceptance Criteria Met:**
- ✓ src/strings.ts exports StringUtils class
- ✓ reverse() reverses any string correctly
- ✓ capitalize() capitalizes first letter of each word
- ✓ wordCount() returns accurate word count

**Next Steps:**
- Ready to proceed with task-005 (Test suite for string utilities)

---

### 2026-01-06 - Iteration 5
**Task:** task-005 - Add test suite for string utilities
**Status:** COMPLETE ✓

**Actions Taken:**
- Created tests/strings.test.ts with comprehensive Jest test suite
- Implemented 20 test cases total across all three string utility methods:
  - reverse: 5 tests (simple string, string with spaces, empty string, single character, special characters)
  - capitalize: 7 tests (single word, multiple words, already capitalized, mixed case, empty string, multiple spaces, single character)
  - wordCount: 8 tests (simple sentence, single word, empty string, whitespace-only, multiple spaces, leading/trailing spaces, many words, tabs/newlines)
- All edge cases covered: empty strings, whitespace-only strings, special characters, multiple spaces, tabs/newlines as whitespace
- Ran `npm test` successfully - all 38 tests pass (18 calculator + 20 strings = 38/38 green)
- Verified `npm run build` still succeeds without errors

**Acceptance Criteria Met:**
- ✓ tests/strings.test.ts exists
- ✓ All string functions have test coverage (reverse: 5 tests, capitalize: 7 tests, wordCount: 8 tests)
- ✓ Empty string edge cases handled (empty string, whitespace-only tested across all methods)
- ✓ npm test passes with all tests green (38/38 passed)

**Next Steps:**
- All PRD tasks (task-001 through task-005) are now complete
