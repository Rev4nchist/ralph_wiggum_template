# Progress Log - agent-backend

Started: Integration Test Setup
Agent Type: backend
Specialist Modes: implement, test

## Initial Context
This is a multi-agent integration test. Building a Todo API that will be consumed by agent-frontend.

## Critical Coordination Points
- Task be-004 creates shared/types.ts - MUST lock file before editing
- Frontend agent will wait for be-004 completion before proceeding
- Store handoff notes when completing be-004

## Memory Protocol
- Note any architectural decisions made
- Record any blockers and solutions
- Leave handoff notes for frontend agent after completing types
