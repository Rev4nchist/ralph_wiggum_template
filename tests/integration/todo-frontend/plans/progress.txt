# Progress Log - agent-frontend

Started: Integration Test Setup
Agent Type: frontend
Specialist Modes: implement, test

## Initial Context
This is a multi-agent integration test. Building a React Todo UI that consumes the backend API.

## Critical Coordination Points
- Task fe-002 waits for backend be-003 (API ready)
- Task fe-003 waits for backend be-004 (shared types)
- Check memory for handoff notes from backend agent

## Memory Protocol
- Recall project context before starting
- Check for backend agent handoff notes
- Note any patterns discovered for future reference
